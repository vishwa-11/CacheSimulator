The main.cpp file is the executable file and contains several methods. The first few are required for numerical conversions and shouldn't be touched. The five main methods required by the user are the Direct Mapped, Fully Associative with LRU, Fully Associative with FIFO, Set Associative with LRU and Set Associative with FIFO methods. When running the Direct Mapped method, you can control the number of sets and bytes per block. In the Set Associative methods, you can select the number of sets, blocks and bytes per block. In the Fully Associative methods, you can select the number of blocks and bytes per block. When running each of these methods, a hit rate will be produced.
